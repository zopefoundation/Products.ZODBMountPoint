Overview
========

Zope ZODB mount point support


Usage example
-------------
You can mount additional storages into the ZODB as seen by the Zope client 
by adding ``zodb_db`` configurations in your Zope configuration file and
specifying where they show up. This example uses the
ZODB `MappingStorage
<https://zodb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/storages.html#mappingstorage>`_
for a simple temporary folder at ``/temp_folder``. After a Zope restart, visit
the Zope Management Interface and select `ZODB Mount Point` from the list of
addable items to view and activate all available mount points::

  <zodb_db temporary>
      <mappingstorage>
        name Temporary database
      </mappingstorage>
      mount-point /temp_folder
      container-class Products.TemporaryFolder.TemporaryContainer
  </zodb_db>

For details on session configuration, see `the Zope book chapter on session
management <https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zopebook/Sessions.html>`_.
